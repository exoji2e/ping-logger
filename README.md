Loggs ping to 8.8.8.8 continuously

After many experiences of bad internet connections I'd like to know excatly how bad my connection is.
Therefore I ordered a respberrypi3, which I hope will arrive soon. 

I'm tierd of hearing that I should switch my perfectly fine router, 
having data on when and to what extent an internet goes down might help in the grand battle versus the ISP's.
